# outlearn heroku-buildpack-newrelic-deploy

Custom Outlearn buildpack reporting deployments to the NewRelic API

**note**: this is no longer maintained as the project that used it is in active.  This now uses an older version of the buildpack API.  If you have a fork that is functionally the same but maintained, we're happy to add a link from here to a suggested replacement.
